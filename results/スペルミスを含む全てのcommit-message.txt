xz: Add a message if --block-list is used outside of xz compresssion.

--block-list is only supported with compression in xz format. This avoids
silently ignoring when --block-list is unused.

Build: Create doxygen/update-doxygen script.

This is a helper script to generate the Doxygen documentation. It can be
run in 'liblzma' or 'internal' mode by setting the first argument. It
will default to 'liblzma' mode and only generate documentation for the
liblzma API header files.

The helper script will be run during the custom mydist hook when we
create releases. This hook already alters the source directory, so its
fine to do it here too. This way, we can include the Doxygen generated
files in the distrubtion and when installing.

In 'liblzma' mode, the JavaScript is stripped from the .html files and
the .js files are removed. This avoids license hassle from jQuery and
other libraries that Doxygen 1.9.6 puts into jquery.js in minified form.

CI: Add Windows runner for Autotools builds with MSYS2.

Only a subset of the tests run by the Linux and MacOS Autotools builds
are run. The most interesting tests are the ones that disable threads,
encoders, and decoders.

The Windows runner will only be run manually since these tests will
likely take much longer than the Linux and MacOS runners. This runner
should be used before merging any large features and before releases.

Currently the clang64 environment fails to due to a warning and
-Werror is enabled for the CI tests. This is still an early version
since the CMake build can be done for MSVC and optionally each of the
MSYS2 environments. GitHub does not allow manually running the CI tests
unless the workflow is checked on the default branch so checking in a
minimum version is a good idea.

Thanks to Arthur S for the original proposing the original patch.

Closes: https://github.com/tukaani-project/xz/pull/34

liblzma: Add overflow check for Unpadded size in lzma_index_append().

This was not a security bug since there was no path to overflow
UINT64_MAX in lzma_index_append() or when it calls index_file_size().
The bug was discovered by a failing assert() in vli_ceil4() when called
from index_file_size() when unpadded_sum (the sum of the compressed size
of current Stream and the unpadded_size parameter) exceeds LZMA_VLI_MAX.

Previously, the unpadded_size parameter was checked to be not greater
than UNPADDED_SIZE_MAX, but no check was done once compressed_base was
added.

This could not have caused an integer overflow in index_file_size() when
called by lzma_index_append(). The calculation for file_size breaks down
into the sum of:

- Compressed base from all previous Streams
- 2 * LZMA_STREAM_HEADER_SIZE (size of the current Streams header and
  footer)
- stream_padding (can be set by lzma_index_stream_padding())
- Compressed base from the current Stream
- Unpadded size (parameter to lzma_index_append())

The sum of everything except for Unpadded size must be less than
LZMA_VLI_MAX. This is guarenteed by overflow checks in the functions
that can set these values including lzma_index_stream_padding(),
lzma_index_append(), and lzma_index_cat(). The maximum value for
Unpadded size is enforced by lzma_index_append() to be less than or
equal UNPADDED_SIZE_MAX. Thus, the sum cannot exceed UINT64_MAX since
LZMA_VLI_MAX is half of UINT64_MAX.

Thanks to Joona Kannisto for reporting this.

liblzma: Initialize lzma_lz_encoder pointers with NULL.

This fixes the recent change to lzma_lz_encoder that used memzero
instead of the NULL constant. On some compilers the NULL constant
(always 0) may not equal the NULL pointer (this only needs to guarentee
to not point to valid memory address).

Later code compares the pointers to the NULL pointer so we must
initialize them with the NULL pointer instead of 0 to guarentee
code correctness.

liblzma: Clarify lzma_lzma_preset() documentation in lzma12.h.

lzma_lzma_preset() does not guarentee that the lzma_options_lzma are
usable in an encoder even if it returns false (success). If liblzma
is built with default configurations, then the options will always be
usable. However if the match finders hc3, hc4, or bt4 are disabled, then
the options may not be usable depending on the preset level requested.

The documentation was updated to reflect this complexity, since this
behavior was unclear before.

lib: Update getopt.c from Gnulib with modifications.

The code maintains the prior modifications of conditionally including
config.h and disabling NLS support.

_GL_UNUSED is repalced with the simple cast to void trick. _GL_UNUSED
is only used for these two parameters so its simpler than having to
define it.

Doxygen: Update Doxyfile.in from 1.4.7 to 1.8.17.

A few Doxygen tags were obsolete from 1.4.7. Version 1.8.17 released
in 2019, so this should be compatible with resonable modern distros.
The purpose of Doxygen these days is for docs on the website, so it
doesn't necessarily have to work for everyone. Just when the maintainers
want to update the docs.

CMake: Move sandbox detection outside of xz section.

The sandbox is now enabled for xzdec as well, so it no longer belongs
in just the xz section. xz and xzdec are always built, except for older
MSVC versions, so there isn't a need to conditionally show the sandbox
configuration. CMake will do a little unecessary work on older MSVC
versions that can't build xz or xzdec, but this is a very small
downside.

Windows: Include <intrin.h> when needed.

Legacy Windows did not need to #include <intrin.h> to use the MSVC
intrinsics. Newer versions likely just issue a warning, but the MSVC
documentation says to include the header file for the intrinsics we use.

GCC and Clang can \"pretend\" to be MSVC on Windows, so extra checks are
needed in tuklib_integer.h to only include <intrin.h> when it will is
actually needed.

xz: Includes <time.h> and <sys/time.h> conditionally in mytime.c.

Previously, mytime.c depended on mythread.h for <time.h> to be included.


CI: Add doxygen as a dependency.

Autogen now requires --no-doxygen or having doxygen installed to run
without errors.


CI: Fix windows-ci dependency installation.

All of the MSYS2 environments need make, and it does not come with the
toolchain package. The toolchain package will install the needed
compiler toolchains since without this package CMake cannot properly
generate the Makefiles.


CI/CD: Reduce job runners to 4 instead of using matrix strategy.

The old version used too many runners that resulted in unnecessary
dependency downloads. Now, the runners are reused for the different
configurations for each OS and build system.


CI: Removes CMakeCache.txt between builds.

If the cache file is not removed, CMake will not reset configurations
back to their default values. In order to make the tests independent, it
is simplest to purge the cache. Unfortunatly, this will slow down the
tests a little and repeat some checks.


tuklib_physmem: Silence warning from -Wcast-function-type on MinGW-w64.

tuklib_physmem depends on GetProcAddress() for both MSVC and MinGW-w64
to retrieve a function address. The proper way to do this is to cast the
return value to the type of function pointer retrieved. Unfortunately,
this causes a cast-function-type warning, so the best solution is to
simply ignore the warning.


Build: Remove Gnulib dependency from tests.

The tests do not use any Gnulib replacements so they do not need to link
libgnu.a or have /lib in the include path.


CI: Add apt update command before installing dependencies.

Without the extra command, all of the CI tests were automatically
failing because the Ubuntu servers could not be reached properly.


liblzma: Clarify lzma_lzma_preset() documentation in lzma12.h.

lzma_lzma_preset() does not guarentee that the lzma_options_lzma are
usable in an encoder even if it returns false (success). If liblzma
is built with default configurations, then the options will always be
usable. However if the match finders hc3, hc4, or bt4 are disabled, then
the options may not be usable depending on the preset level requested.

The documentation was updated to reflect this complexity, since this
behavior was unclear before.
